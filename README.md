# Trunfo-Of-Death

I created this project in collaboration with Alura during the Imers√£o Dev.

This repository contains the source code and necessary resources to play the classic card game "Super Trunfo". The Super Trunfo game is a web implementation developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective is to provide fun and entertainment to the players.

## Game Rules

The basic rules of the Super Trunfo game are as follows:

1. The game is played with a deck of cards, each containing information about a specific object, such as cars, animals, countries, etc.

2. Each card has different attributes (such as speed, weight, height, power, etc.) with specific values.

3. The objective of the game is to collect all the cards in the deck. Players receive an equal number of cards at the beginning of the game.

4. The player who starts the round chooses one attribute from their card to compare with the corresponding attribute of the opponent's card.

5. The attribute values are compared, and the player with the higher value wins the round and collects the opponent's card.

6. The winning player of the next round chooses a new attribute for comparison.

7. The game continues until one player has all the cards in the deck.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file of the game.
- `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for the style and layout of the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
- `assets/`: This directory contains the necessary resources for the game, such as card images and other files.

## How to Play

To play Super Trunfo, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
